# Lesson 03: Flow Control
  
'Python flow control with conditionals and loops (if, while, for, range, etc.)'
  
Here are some key notes taken from this lesson which may help with the exercises.

## Comparisons
The comparison operators are `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `!=`, and `==`. When working with numbers, they do what you think: return `True` or `False` depending on whether the statement is true or false.  
__Note: Python2.x will let you try to compare any two objects, no matter how different. The results may not be what you expect. Python3.x only compares types where a comparison operation has been defined__
