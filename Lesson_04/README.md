# Lesson 04: Container Data Types
  
Here are some key notes taken from this lesson which may help with the exercises.

## Introduction
Data Containers allow us to build up complicated structures. There are different ways of putting data into containers, depending on what we need to do with it, and Python has several built-in containers to support the most common use cases. Python's built-in container types include:
1. `list`
2. `tuple`
3. `dict`
4. `set`
5. `frozenset`
  
Of these, `tuple` and `frozenset` are **immutable**, which means that they cannot be changed after they are created, whether that's by addition, removal, or some other means. Numbers and strings are also immutable, which should make the following statement more sensible: the **variable** that names an immutable object can be reassigned, but the immutable object itself can't be changed.  
To create an instance of any container, we call its name as a function (sometimes known as a *constructor*). With no arguments, we get an empty instance, which isn't very useful for immutable types. Shortcuts for creating non-empty lists, tuples, dicts, and even sets will be covered in the following sections.  
Many built-in functions and even some operators work with container types, where it makes sense.

## Lists
A list is an ordered sequence of zero or more objects, which are often of different types. It is commonly created by putting square brackets [] around a comma-separated list of its initial values:
`fruit = ['Apple', 'Orange', 'Pear', 'Lime']`

Values can be added to or removed from the list in different ways: 
```python 
fruit.append(â€™Banana')
fruit.insert(3,'Cherry')
fruit.extend(['Cherry','Banana'])
fruit.remove('Banana')
fruit.pop()
```

## List Comprehension
One of the most common uses of a list is to iterate over its elements with a `for` loop, storing off the results of each iteration in a new list. Python removes the repetitive boilerplate code from this type of procedure with **listcomprehensions**.
`d = [[i, i ** 2, i ** 3] for i in range(10) if i % 2]`

## Sorting and Reordering
The `sorted` function works on more than just lists, but always returns a new list with the same contents as the original in sorted order. There is also a `sort` method on lists that performs an in-place sort.
```python
sorted_fruit = sorted(fruit)
fruit.sort()
```

Reversing the order of a list is similar, with a built-in `reversed` function and an in-place `reverse` method for lists. The `reversed` function returns an iterator, which must be converted back into a list explicitly. To sort something in reverse, you *could* combine the `reversed` and the `sorted` methods, but you *should* use the optional `reverse` argument on the `sorted` and `sort` functions.
```python
r_fruit = list(reversed(fruit))
fruit.reverse()
sorted(r_fruit, reverse = True)
```

## Tuples
Much like a list, a `tuple` is an ordered sequence of zero or more objects of any type. They can be constructed by putting a comma-separated list of items inside parentheses (), or even by assigning a comma-separated list to a variable with no delimiters at all. Parentheses are heavily overloaded-they also indicate function calls and mathematical order of operations--so defining a one-element tuple is tricky: the one element must be followed by a comma. Because a `tuple` is **immutable**, it won't have any of the methods that change lists, like `append` or `sort`. 
`a = (1, 2, 'first and second')`

## Interlude: Index and Slice Notation
For the ordered containers `list` and `tuple`, as well as for other ordered types like strings, it's often useful to retrieve or change just one element or a subset of the elements, *Index* and *slice* notation are available to help with this. Indexes in Python always start at 0. We'll start out with a new list and work by example:
```python
animals = ['tiger', 'monkey', 'cat', 'dog', 'horse', 'elephant']
animals[l]
animals[1:3]
animals[::-1] == list(reversed(animals))
```
Becauses slicing returns a new list and not just a view on the list, it can be used to make a copy (technically a `shallow` copy)
```python
same_animals = animals
different_animals = animals[:]
same_animals[0] = 'lion'
animals[0]
different_animals[0] = 'leopard'
different_animals[0] == animals[0]
```

## Dictionaries
A `dict` is a container that associates keys with values. The keys of a `dict` must be unique, and only immutable objects can be keys. Values can be any type. The dictionary construction shortcut uses curly braces { } with a colon : between keys and values (e.g. `my_dict = {key: value, keyl: value1))`. Alternate constructors are available using the `dict` keyword. Values can be added, changed, or retrieved using index notation with *keys* instead of *index* numbers. Some of the operators, functions, and methods that work on sequences also work with dictionaries.
